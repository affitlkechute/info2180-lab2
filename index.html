                <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its emphasis on code readability through significant indentation. It's dynamically typed and garbage-collected, supporting multiple programming paradigms like structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. Often called a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library, Python has gained significant popularity, especially in the machine learning community.

                    Guido van Rossum started developing Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, releasing it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 followed in 2000, and Python 3.0, a major revision not fully compatible with earlier versions, was released in 2008. Python 2.7.18, the last release of Python 2, came out in 2020</p>
                <p>Python's popularity can be attributed to its versatility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development and data analysis to scientific computing and automation.</p>

             <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

                It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
                
                C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system</p>
             <p>Why Learn C?
                It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
                If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
                C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
                C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies
